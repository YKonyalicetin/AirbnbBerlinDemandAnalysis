# Analysis and Prediction for Airbnb Demand in Berlin

## Introduction
Airbnb gained a lot of popularity in the past decade and is a widely used platform for the booking of touristic acommodations in major cities. The evergrowing popularity for acommodations in Berlin, Germany's most populous city and a popular destination for tourists around the world, can be seen in the following graph.

It can be noted that bookings, approximated by the sum of reviews on acommodations, follow a clear upward trend (if we ignore COVID-19 pandemic's drastic impact on reviews in February and March 2020). Furthermore, a seasonal pattern is evident when observing the peaks at turns of years and low points around the Christmas period.

By using the number of reviews as an approximation for the demand of Airbnb accommodations, this analysis gives important insights into market developments.
